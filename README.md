## 🧠 What It Does

People make daily decisions about time, learning, habits, and careers without understanding long-term consequences. **Most regret in life comes from repeated small poor decisions, not a single failure.**

This AI agent answers one powerful question:

> *"If my current lifestyle continues, what will I regret in the future?"*

## ⚙️ Intelligence Logic

### How the AI Thinks

The agent uses **rule-based intelligence** — no deep learning, no API calls, no GPU required.

```
1. Collect user data (daily habits, weekly metrics, self-reflection)
2. Load career-specific benchmarks (ideal study hrs, max screen time, etc.)
3. Compute gaps between current habits and ideal benchmarks
4. Score each gap by severity (LOW → CRITICAL)
5. Aggregate into 5 weighted sub-scores
6. Calculate final Regret Score (0–100)
7. Classify regret types (Career, Skill, Time Waste, Health, Financial)
8. Simulate future scenarios with time-horizon decay multipliers
9. Generate STOP/START recommendations using rule engine
10. Output complete report with motivational feedback
```

### Scoring Formula

```
Future Regret Score = Σ (1 − sub_score_i) × weight_i × 100
```

| Sub-Score | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Consistency | 0.20 | Self-rated consistency level (1–10) |
| Productivity | 0.20 | Self-rated focus level (1–10) |
| Distraction | 0.20 | Screen time + distraction hours vs limits |
| Goal Alignment | 0.25 | Study + coding hours vs career benchmarks |
| Learning Effort | 0.15 | Skill learning + courses + projects vs benchmarks |

### Career Benchmarks

The agent ships with ideal daily/weekly benchmarks for **7 career paths**:

| Career | Study hrs | Coding hrs | Max Screen | Max Distraction | Min Sleep |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| Software Engineer | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 7 |
| AI/ML Engineer | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 7 |
| Data Scientist | 3.5 | 2.5 | 3 | 1 | 7 |
| Government Job | 6 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 7 |
| Business / Startup | 2 | 1 | 3 | 1.5 | 7 |
| Freelancer | 2 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 7 |
| Other | 2 | 1 | 3 | 1.5 | 7 |

### Regret Categories

| Type | Triggered By |
|------|-------------|
| 🏢 Career Regret | Low study hours, few projects, poor consistency |
| 🛠️ Skill Regret | Low skill practice, no courses, learning gaps |
| ⏳ Time Waste Regret | High screen time, excessive distraction hours |
| ❤️ Health Regret | Sleep deficit, no exercise |
| 💰 Financial Regret | Derived from career + skill risk compounding |

### Future Simulation

Predictions scale across time horizons using multipliers:

| Horizon | Multiplier | Effect |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| 3 months | 0.6× | Early warning signals |
| 6 months | 0.8× | Noticeable gaps forming |
| 1 year | 1.0× | Full impact of current habits |
| 2 years | 1.2× | Compounded consequences |
